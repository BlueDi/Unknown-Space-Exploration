# Unknown Space Exploration
In this project we developped a multi-agent system that can explore an unknown environments with obstacles.

It was developed using [JADE](http://jade.tilab.com/) & [Repast Simphony](https://repast.github.io/) & [SAJaS](https://web.fe.up.pt/~hlc/doku.php?id=sajas).

All the documentation is on the [Wiki of this repository](https://github.com/BlueDi/Unknown-Space-Exploration/wiki).

## Setup
The setup has to be done manualy using Eclipse IDE with Repast Simphony library. We recommend installing everything using the Eclipse version that Repast Simphony provides.
1. Create a Repast Simphony project with name as unknownexplorer;
2. Add the src files and the unknownexplorer.rs files.
3. In the project, add the libraries Jade & SAJaS to the Java Build Path. The libraries are included in the lib folder.
